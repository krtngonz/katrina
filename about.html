      <p class="justify">
        <b>Hello! My name is Katrina Joy Gonzalvo.</b> I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Office Administration, a program that helped me build strong skills in Microsoft Office applications, data entry, document management, scheduling, and various administrative tasks. Throughout my academic journey and personal experiences, I have become known for being detail-oriented, reliable, and adaptable, allowing me to thrive in fast-paced and dynamic environments.
      </p>

      <p class="justify">
        I enjoy taking on new challenges because they help me grow, improve, and expand my knowledge. Learning new things—whether related to office work, technology, or creative pursuits—is something I value greatly. I believe that continuous learning and self-improvement are essential to becoming more capable and confident both professionally and personally.
      </p>

      <p class="justify">
        I am passionate about continuous learning, personal development, organization, and creating efficient workflows. I take pride in helping others, supporting team operations, and contributing to a productive work environment. I also have a passion for creativity and technology, especially in areas that allow me to explore, express myself, and learn new skills.
